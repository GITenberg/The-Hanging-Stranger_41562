description: <p>When Ed Loyce heads to work at his TV repair shop, he is startled
  to find the dead body of a complete stranger hanging from a lamp post outside. But
  when he calls attention to the morbid display, the strange reactions of his friends
  and neighbours bring him to a disturbing realization.</p><p>Philip K. Dick was an
  American science-fiction novelist, short-story writer and essayist. His first short
  story, "Beyond Lies the Wub," was published shortly after his high school graduation.
  Some of his most famous short stories were adapted for film, including "The Minority
  Report," "Paycheck," "Second Variety" (adapted into the film <em>Screamers</em>)
  and "We Can Remember It For You Wholesale" (adapted into the film <em>Total Recall</em>).</p><p>HarperCollins
  brings great works of literature to life in digital format, upholding the highest
  standards in ebook production and celebrating reading in all its forms. Look for
  more titles in the HarperCollins short-stories collection to build...
